The object of the game is to get your character across the road without touching any bugs!!

You can choose your character and enemy type at the start of the game by clicking on the picture in each section.

To move your player use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the character up, down, left, and right.

If you touch a bug you will be teleported back to the beginning, allowing you to start over.

If you make it into the water you will be presented with a victory screen allowing you to play again!
